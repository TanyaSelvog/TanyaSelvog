I am a Software Development. My interests include: Cloud, AI + ML, representation in tech, and quantum computing. I love learning 🤓 and have degrees in Software Development and Religious Studies. I have several Azure certificates, a few Comptia+ certs, and I'm currently on a 500 days streak on Duolingo. 😆

When I'm not programming, I'm busy being a cat mom 😸, building LEGO 🧱, running 🏃‍♀️, and watching the Sounders and Kraken.
